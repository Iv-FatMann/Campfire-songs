dream dream dream dream
dream dream dream dream 

when i want you in my arms
when i want you and all your charms
whenever i want you 
all i have to do is dream
dream dream dream dream

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away
